# Boom Library Management - Software Library

The **Boom Library Management** project is a Django-based web application designed to streamline the management of library resources. It allows users to update the borrowing status of books, search, and filter through the library's collection. The system also includes administrative features such as adding, updating, and deleting books. Its user-friendly interface ensures that both regular users and administrators can efficiently manage and access library resources.

To ensure optimal database performance, the application uses a **MySQL database**, providing reliable and scalable data storage for managing large amounts of library data.

## Application Authentication

The application features a secure login and user authentication system, allowing both regular users and administrators to access their respective features. Users can authenticate using their credentials before interacting with the library system.
