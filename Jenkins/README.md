# Jenkins Pipelines

This repository contains Jenkins pipelines for different parts of the application and infrastructure management process. The pipelines utilize a shared library from the following repository: [Jenkins Shared Library](https://github.com/Macarious-GK/Jenkins-Shared-Library.git).

## SSDLC Integration
- The Jenkins pipelines incorporate SSDLC principles by applying the "shift-left" approach, which integrates security testing early in the development lifecycle. This proactive method helps address vulnerabilities before they reach production. 
- Key security measures include code linting, static application security testing, and Docker image scanning
## Credential Management
- **Credentials Storage**: Use Jenkinsâ€™ credentials management to securely store sensitive information like API keys and passwords.
- **Environment Variables**: Access credentials via environment variables configured in Jenkins.

## Security Authorization
- **Mixed Security Authorization**: Segment access permissions based on roles and responsibilities.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Ensure users and services have only the permissions needed for their tasks.

## Plugin Installation

### Required Plugins
1. **AWS Credentials Plugin**: For managing AWS credentials in Jenkins.
2. **GitHub Plugin**: For integrating Jenkins with GitHub repositories.

#### Install Plugins
1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Plugins**.
2. Select the plugins and click **Install without Restart**.

## Jenkins Shared Library

The pipelines in this repository make use of a shared library to promote reusable and modular pipeline steps. The shared library is hosted in the following GitHub repository: [Jenkins Shared Library](https://github.com/Macarious-GK/Jenkins-Shared-Library.git).

To use the shared library in your Jenkins pipeline, add the following configuration to your `Jenkinsfile`:

```groovy
@Library('Jenkins-Shared-Library') _
// Pipeline Code
```

## Setup WebHook

### Configure WebHook in GitHub:
1. Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings** -> **Webhooks** -> **Add Webhook**.
2. Set the "Payload URL" to `http://your-jenkins-server/github-webhook/`.
3. Set content type to `application/json`.
4. Choose **Just the push event** and click **Add Webhook**.

### Enable WebHook in Jenkins:
1. In your Jenkins job, under **Build Triggers**, select **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
2. Ensure Jenkins is configured with the GitHub plugin to receive webhooks.


## How to Run the Pipelines
1. Configure Jenkins Shared Library under **Manage Jenkins** -> **Configure System** -> **Global Pipeline Libraries**.
2. Update your `Jenkinsfile` to use the shared library.
3. Trigger pipelines through Jenkins UI or set automated SCM-based triggers.





## Pipeline Stages

1. **Environment Check**
   - Validates the Ansible installation and its version.
   - Ensures the execution environment is ready.

2. **Parameterized Configuration**
   - Flexible inputs for inventory files, credentials, and playbooks.

4. **Post-Build Actions**
   - **Always**: Cleans up the workspace to maintain a clean build environment.
   - **On Success**: Send Email with success message.
   - **On Failure**: Send Email with error message.
